Complete End-to-End Workflow for RepoInsight AI Architectural Analysis
Let me map out every step from repository upload to displaying architectural analysis results:

Phase 1: Frontend - File Upload & Validation
Step 1: User Interaction
User clicks "Choose Folder" or drags repository folder
Browser file picker opens with webkitdirectory attribute
User selects entire repository folder
Frontend validates file selection
Step 2: File Processing & Validation
Extract file list from FileList object
Filter out binary/unwanted files (.git, node_modules, .exe, etc.)
Validate file sizes (warn if total > 50MB)
Count total lines of code across all files
Display upload summary to user
Show progress indicator
Step 3: Pre-Analysis Preparation
Build file tree structure for display
Identify primary programming languages
Detect project type (web app, desktop, etc.)
Show analysis options (currently just Architectural)
User clicks "Run Architectural Analysis"
Phase 2: Frontend to Backend Communication
Step 4: API Request Preparation
Create FormData object with all files
Add metadata (project name, analysis type)
Set up progress tracking for upload
Configure timeout for long analysis (5-10 minutes)
Step 5: HTTP Request to Backend
POST to /api/analyze/architectural
Stream file upload with progress updates
Display "Analysis in Progress" UI
Handle network errors and timeouts
Phase 3: Backend - File Processing
Step 6: File Reception & Validation
Receive multipart form data
Validate file types and sizes
Extract file contents to memory
Create temporary file structure
Log analysis request details
Step 7: Code Analysis Preparation
Parse file extensions to identify languages
Extract code content from each file
Remove comments and whitespace (optional)
Calculate total token count estimation
Determine chunking strategy based on size
Step 8: Intelligent Code Chunking
python
# For large repositories (>100K tokens):
1. Identify file boundaries and dependencies
2. Group related files (same module/package)
3. Create logical chunks with context overlap
4. Maintain file relationship mapping
5. Prepare chunk metadata

# For single large files (5000+ lines):
1. Parse function/class boundaries
2. Extract imports and dependencies
3. Create overlapping sections
4. Maintain context between chunks
Phase 4: OpenAI GPT Integration
Step 9: Prompt Engineering & Context Preparation
Create system prompt for architectural analysis
Format code with proper structure
Add context about programming language
Include specific analysis requirements
Prepare few-shot examples if needed
Step 10: GPT API Calls
python
# Strategy A: Single Large Analysis
1. Combine all code into one context
2. Send to GPT-4 Turbo (128K context)
3. Request structured architectural analysis

# Strategy B: Multi-Stage Analysis (for very large repos)
1. Analyze individual components first
2. Synthesize component analyses
3. Generate overall architecture view
4. Create integration diagrams
Step 11: Response Processing
Parse GPT response for structured data
Extract architectural components
Generate Mermaid diagram syntax
Validate diagram syntax
Format analysis results
Phase 5: Response Formatting & Validation
Step 12: Structure Analysis Results
json
{
  "analysis_id": "uuid",
  "repository_info": {
    "name": "project-name",
    "language": "COBOL",
    "total_files": 15,
    "total_lines": 5247,
    "analysis_duration": "45s"
  },
  "architectural_analysis": {
    "overview": "High-level architecture description",
    "components": [...],
    "patterns": [...],
    "dependencies": [...]
  },
  "diagrams": {
    "sequence_diagram": {
      "title": "Main Process Flow",
      "mermaid_code": "sequenceDiagram...",
      "description": "..."
    },
    "component_diagram": {
      "title": "System Components",
      "mermaid_code": "graph TD...",
      "description": "..."
    }
  },
  "recommendations": [...],
  "insights": [...]
}
Step 13: Diagram Generation & Validation
Generate Mermaid syntax for diagrams
Validate Mermaid syntax
Create fallback text descriptions
Optimize diagram complexity for readability
Phase 6: Frontend - Result Display
Step 14: Response Reception
Receive analysis results from backend
Parse JSON response
Handle any errors or warnings
Update UI state with results
Step 15: Analysis Panel Updates
Switch to "Architectural Analysis" tab
Display analysis overview
Show repository statistics
Render architectural insights
Step 16: Diagram Visualization
Render Mermaid diagrams using mermaid.js
Create interactive diagram viewers
Add zoom/pan functionality
Provide diagram export options
Step 17: Results Presentation
Display architectural components list
Show identified patterns
Present recommendations
Add copy/export functionality
Phase 7: Error Handling & Edge Cases
Step 18: Error Scenarios
File too large for analysis
OpenAI API rate limits
Invalid code syntax
Network timeouts
Unsupported file types
Step 19: Progress Tracking
File upload progress
Analysis stage indicators
Estimated completion time
Partial results display
